# Block Reward Distribution

## Reward Categories

Block rewards are distributed across multiple participant types:

### Execution Nodes

- Share of Execution Layer block rewards
- Portion of transaction fees

### Training Nodes (ICN)

- Rewards based on Training Points via PoIC
- Share of the ICN reward pool in $AEV

### Content / Knowledge Nodes

- Rewards based on Library Points via PoIC
- Compensation based on data contribution and usage

### Witness Nodes & Committers

- Witness rewards based on signature participation
- Extra Committer rewards for block packaging duties

## Dynamic Allocation

Over time, block rewards shift from "raw hardware compute" toward "knowledge content and applications", guiding the network from an infrastructure phase into a knowledge-prosperity phase.
