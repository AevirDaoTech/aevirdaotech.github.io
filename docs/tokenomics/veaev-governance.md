# veAEV Governance & Locking Mechanism

## Staking Mechanics

### Operational Staking

Execution Nodes and Contributor Nodes must stake $AEV as a performance bond against Slashing Risks (e.g., malicious behavior or downtime).

This grants network access, but explicitly separates labor from capital control—staking alone does not confer governance rights or $AUV minting capabilities.

### Governance Locking

Governance power is derived exclusively from **Governance Locking**:

1. Users time-lock $AEV to receive $veAEV
2. Longer lock periods yield more veAEV
3. veAEV decays over time as lock period expires

## veAEV Benefits

$veAEV holders can:

- **Govern**: Vote on protocol parameters, treasury allocation, and content consensus
- **Mint**: Produce $AUV based on veAEV holdings
- **Boost**: Receive enhanced rewards through contribution multipliers

## Anti-Plutocracy Design

The protocol uses a **logarithmic weighting formula** to mitigate plutocracy:

- Massive capital accumulation yields diminishing returns in voting power
- Ensures smaller contributors maintain meaningful voice
- Balances capital influence with time commitment
