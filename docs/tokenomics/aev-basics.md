# $AEV Token Basics & Supply Design

## The Dual-Token Model

Aevir employs a dual-token architecture to resolve the conflict between "Store of Value" and "Medium of Exchange":

- **$AEV**: The protocol's equity, capturing long-term value and securing consensus
- **$AUV**: The high-velocity utility token for daily transactions

This separation ensures that the deflationary mechanics required for asset appreciation do not hinder the liquidity needed for high-frequency AI model inference.

## $AEV (Governance Token)

### Store of Value

Capped at 1 billion tokens, $AEV is the economic collateral for network security. It functions as a deflationary asset where value accrues through fee burning and inelastic demand for production rights. It represents ownership of the "Collective Intelligence" network and is the sole carrier of governance rights.

### Fair Launch Principles

Aevir commits to a **100% Fair Launch**:

- No pre-mine
- No private sale
- No team allocation

Tokens are distributed exclusively through Proof of Intelligent Contribution (PoIC) or testnet incentives.

## $AUV (Utility Token)

### Medium of Exchange

$AUV acts as the "ecological fuel" for the network:

- Dedicated currency for AI inference payments
- Data contributor rewards
- Agent settlements

Its supply is elastic, regulated by a Macro Demand Factor.

### Minting & Burning

- $AUV is minted strictly by $veAEV holders based on Capital Scale and Time Commitment
- Fees from services are permanently burned
- Creates dynamic balance where consumption drives production value
