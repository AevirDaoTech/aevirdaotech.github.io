# Parameter Sensitivity & System Risks

## Basic Risk Management Principles

### 1. Diversify Risk

- Don't put everything into one role/strategy (all-lock, all-stake, etc.)
- Separate funds by purpose (trading, long-term, ops bond)

### 2. Informed Participation

- Understand Aevir's architecture, tokenomics, and governance before committing
- Track proposals and community updates

### 3. Security Over Yield

- Operators and large participants should prioritize safety and stability
- Don't chase short-term yield at the expense of long-term security

## Parameter Change Impact

DAO governance may change key parameters affecting:

- Staking yields
- ICN/content node payback periods
- Sustainability of certain app models

## Mitigation Strategies

- Stay informed about governance proposals
- Participate in voting to influence parameter changes
- Maintain flexibility in participation strategy
- Keep reserves for unexpected changes
