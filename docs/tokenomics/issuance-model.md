# Issuance Model & Dynamic Decay Curve

## Issuance Schedule

Supply follows a deterministic decay function:

- **95%** allocated for PoIC mining
- Issuance rate dynamically decreases as circulating supply grows
- Transitions from initial high-rate phase to asymptotic low-rate phase (converging to 1%)

This mathematically aligns inflation with network maturity.

## The Value Flywheel

The ecosystem operates on a closed-loop value system:

1. Users lock $AEV to acquire $veAEV
2. $veAEV acts as "productive capital" to mint new $AUV
3. Ecosystem activities consume and burn $AUV
4. As demand rises, utility demand drives governance token value

This aligns network usage with stakeholder returns.
