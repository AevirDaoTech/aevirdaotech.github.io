# Create Wallet / Get Test Tokens

## Create / Import a Wallet

If you already installed a wallet, you can skip this.

1. Open the browser wallet, click "Create new wallet"
2. Set a strong password and back up the seed phrase:
   - Write it down on paper and store safely
   - Do not store it in cloud drives, chats, or email
3. Or choose "Import wallet" and enter your existing seed phrase / private key

> **Note**: Never enter your seed phrase on any web page; ensure it's inside your wallet app.
