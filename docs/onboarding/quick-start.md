# Quick Start

This section is for first-time Aevir users and developers. It helps you complete three things quickly:

1. Prepare your wallet and network setup
2. Get test tokens (if on testnet)
3. Finish your first AI task on Aevir

## Step 1: Prepare Wallet and Network

1. **Choose and install a wallet** (browser extension)

   - Recommended: wallets that support custom EVM-compatible / Cosmos-style networks
   - Create a new wallet or import an existing one
   - Back up your seed phrase securely; avoid screenshots or cloud storage

2. **Add the Aevir network**

   - Open wallet → Network settings / Add custom network
   - Fill in the Aevir network parameters
   - Save and switch to the Aevir network

3. **Verify your address**
   - Copy your Aevir address in the wallet
   - Open the Aevir block explorer, search your address, and confirm it resolves

## Step 2: Get Testnet Tokens

If you're on the Aevir testnet, you'll need test $AEV for gas and tasks.

1. Open the Aevir official faucet page
2. Paste your Aevir address
3. Complete the CAPTCHA / human check
4. Click "Claim test tokens"
5. Wait a few seconds and check your wallet for the new balance

## Step 3: Experience Your First AI Task

See the [First AI Task](./first-ai-task.md) guide for a complete walkthrough.
