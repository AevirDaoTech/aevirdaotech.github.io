# Economic Risks

> This is not investment or legal advice; it's for disclosure and education only.

## 1. Price Volatility

As a freely traded crypto asset, $AEV can:

- Swing sharply in the short term
- Move with market sentiment, macro conditions, and industry news

Participation modes (holding $AEV, staking for nodes, locking for $veAEV) all face P&L swings.

**Practices:**

- Don't commit more than you can afford to lose
- Understand how lockup/unlock cycles affect liquidity
- Separate long-term participation from short-term price expectations

## 2. Liquidity Risk

- Early or stressed markets may have shallow depth for $AEV
- Large trades may incur big slippage
- Lockups and unbonding (e.g., 14 days) add liquidity discount

**Practices:**

- Plan lockup size/term carefully
- Operators: keep some "emergency liquidity"
- Large participants: know main venues and depth

## 3. Tokenomics / Parameter Change Risk

- Real-world performance can differ from modeled assumptions
- DAO governance may change key parameters (rewards, fees)

**Practices:**

- Know current parameters and possible future changes
- Follow proposals and discussions; vote when relevant
- Don't assume any parameter is "forever"
