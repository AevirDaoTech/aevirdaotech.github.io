# Typical Use Cases

Aevir is a general-purpose AI economic infrastructure with high composability. Here are several typical and easy-to-launch scenarios:

## 1. Decentralized AI Training Platform (DeAI Training)

- Users / protocols can:
  - Initiate training jobs (fine-tuning / retraining / federated learning)
  - Specify datasets and models
  - Specify budget and performance requirements
- The network automatically:
  - Routes jobs to suitable training nodes (ICNs)
  - Records process and results
  - Distributes rewards based on contribution and quality of outcomes

**Target users**: AI teams, open-source communities, enterprises needing custom models.

## 2. Decentralized Inference Service (Inference as a Service)

Similar to a "decentralized OpenAI API":

- Developers send inference requests through Aevir's APIs
- Multiple inference nodes compete or collaborate to provide service
- Price and quality are co-determined by market forces and protocol rules

**Target users**: DApp developers, Web2 apps integrating AI functions.

## 3. Knowledge Base & Retrieval Augmentation (RAG / Knowledge Layer)

- Content / knowledge nodes host high-quality knowledge bases and datasets
- During inference, AI tasks can call designated knowledge sources or use vector retrieval for augmentation
- Data usage is recorded and rewards are distributed based on Library Points

**Target users**: vertical-industry Q&A, enterprise knowledge bases, education content platforms.

## 4. AI Agent / Intelligent Agent Networks

- Multiple AI agents can, on Aevir:
  - Call shared models and data
  - Interact via contracts and messages
  - Use $AEV as incentive and settlement medium
- Agents can have their own micro-economies and strategy logic (pricing, tipping, revenue sharing)

**Target users**: multi-agent systems, automated operations / trading strategies, autonomous toolchains.
