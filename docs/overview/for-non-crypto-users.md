# For Non-Crypto Users

If you come from Web2 or the traditional AI industry, you can think of Aevir as:

> **"A decentralized AI cloud platform + financial settlement layer, collectively owned and operated by the community."**

## How Aevir Differs from Traditional Cloud Services

Compared with common cloud services (such as AWS/GCP), Aevir has several key differences:

### Different Ownership Structure

- **Traditional cloud**: the platform company owns and controls all infrastructure and revenue distribution rules.
- **Aevir**: anyone can run nodes, provide resources, and earn rewards according to algorithmic rules. The rules live on-chain, not in a company contract.

### Settlement and Incentives Built into the Protocol Layer

On Aevir, the execution of AI tasks, the use of data, and the contribution of knowledge content are all automatically recorded as contribution scores (IntelliPoints), and rewards are settled directly to participants through block rewards and fee distribution.

### Verifiable and Composable

- The execution process and results of tasks are verifiable on-chain;
- Different AI services can be composed on Aevir like Lego blocks into more complex applications (such as DeAI protocols, agent networks, on-chain AI financial products, etc.).

## Simple Mental Model

For non‑crypto users, you can simply treat Aevir as:

- **A more open AI cloud**: you can rent compute and call models, with payments and settlement handled by the underlying protocol;
- **A fairer incentive network**: your data, compute, and model optimization are no longer "free fuel" but measurable assets that earn returns.
