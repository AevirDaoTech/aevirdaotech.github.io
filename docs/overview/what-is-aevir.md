# What is Aevir?

Welcome to the Aevir documentation center. This section will help you understand in a few minutes: what Aevir is, what problems it aims to solve, and how it differs from traditional public blockchains and centralized AI cloud platforms.

## Overview

**Aevir is a decentralized blockchain and collective intelligence network built for the AI era.**

In the traditional AI ecosystem, there is a severe mismatch between value creation and value capture:

- Data, compute, and model optimization are contributed in a highly distributed way by countless individuals;
- The vast majority of economic value is captured by a few centralized platforms through black-box mechanisms.

Aevir's goal is to use blockchain and cryptography to transform these "overlooked contributions" into **on-chain assets that are ownable, measurable, and shareable**, and to use a complete economic and consensus system so that:

- People who provide **compute**,
- People who provide **data / knowledge content**,
- Developers who build **AI applications and protocols**,

can all receive rewards in a transparent, contribution-based manner.

## Dual-Layer Consensus Architecture

To simultaneously achieve **high-performance AI computation** and **decentralized security**, Aevir adopts an original **dual-layer consensus architecture**:

- **Execution Layer**: 21 high-performance execution nodes responsible for all transaction and contract execution, achieving sub-second confirmation;
- **Block Production Layer**: a PoIC-based (Proof of Intelligent Contribution) witness network responsible for final block production and security attestation.

On top of this, Aevir uses the native token **$AEV** and the governance form **$veAEV** to build an incentive and governance system that centers on "real contribution".
