# Aevir DAO Overview

AevirDAO is the decentralized sovereign body governing the protocol, designed to align long-term incentives with the prosperity of the "Collective Intelligence" network. Unlike simple token-weighted systems, AevirDAO operates on a **veAEV (Vote-escrowed AEV)** model. Governance rights are not automatic; they are earned by users who commit both capital and time (Locking).

## DAO Structure

The governance architecture is composed of specialized bodies:

- **Aevir Council**: The supreme authority, primarily composed of top-tier Intelligent Contributor (IC) nodes, responsible for high-level strategic direction.
- **Governance Committee**: The executive body elected by veAEV holders, managing treasury, economic parameters, and block fee distribution.
- **Technology Committee**: Core developers and technical experts, tasked with code maintenance, mainnet upgrades, and PoIC algorithm tuning.
- **Oversight Committee**: A supervisory body with emergency powers to pause the protocol in extreme security events.
- **Vertical Sub-DAOs**: Domain-specific governance units (e.g., Legal AI, Finance AI) managing specific model evaluations and content standards.

## How to Form Witness Group

The Witness Group represents the intersection of consensus and governance. While core selection relies on the PoIC consensus algorithm (IntelliPoints ranking), the governance layer plays a critical role in legitimizing these nodes.

- **Performance Benchmarking**: The DAO issues ASH Credentials to nodes passing rigorous hardware performance tests.
- **Election**: veAEV holders participate in the election of the 21 Staking Executor nodes.

## Reputation Weighting

Aevir integrates a **Reputation Boost** mechanism into voting logic:

- **Contribution Multiplier**: High-performing Intelligent Contributors and Knowledge Contributors receive voting coefficient bonuses.
- **Philosophy**: Active builders who add tangible value hold proportionally greater sway than passive capital holders.
