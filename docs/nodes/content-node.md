# Content / Knowledge Node

Content Nodes provide the storage layer for Aevir, hosting datasets, model weights, knowledge bases, and other AI-related data.

## Responsibilities

- Provide storage capacity for the network
- Store corpora, model weights, index data, etc.
- Serve data to training and inference tasks
- Maintain high availability for stored content

## Requirements

- **Storage**: Sufficient capacity for target data types
- **Availability**: High uptime for data serving
- **Registration**: Node registration and storage attestation

## Rewards

- **Library Points**: Earned via PoIC based on:
  - Stored data volume
  - Reference count (how often data is used)
  - Community ratings and votes
- **$AEV**: Rewards based on data contribution and usage

## Data Categories

Content nodes may specialize in:

- Training datasets
- Model weights and checkpoints
- Knowledge bases for RAG
- Vector embeddings and indexes

## Getting Started

1. Prepare storage infrastructure
2. Install content node software
3. Complete storage attestation
4. Register node and data offerings on-chain
5. Begin serving data requests
