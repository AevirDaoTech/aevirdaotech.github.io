# Training Node (ICN - Intelligent Contributor Node)

Training Nodes (also called ICN - Intelligent Contributor Nodes) provide the GPU compute power that drives AI model training on Aevir.

## Responsibilities

- Provide GPU and other compute resources
- Participate in AI model training or retraining
- Execute assigned training tasks
- Report task completion and metrics

## Requirements

- **Hardware**: Qualified GPUs (specific models TBD)
- **Network**: Stable bandwidth for model weight transfers
- **Registration**: Node registration and hardware attestation

## Rewards

- **Training Points**: Earned via PoIC based on:
  - GPU contribution
  - Uptime
  - Task completion rate
- **$AEV**: Share of the ICN reward pool based on contribution

## IntelliPoints Impact

Higher Training Points lead to:

- Increased probability of Witness selection
- Greater share of block rewards
- Enhanced reputation in the network

## Getting Started

1. Verify your GPU meets requirements
2. Install training node software
3. Complete hardware attestation
4. Register node on-chain
5. Begin accepting training tasks
