# Node Types Overview

Aevir's network includes multiple node roles, each suited to different resource profiles and participation styles.

## Node Categories

| Node Type           | Primary Function       | Key Requirements         | Reward Type          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Execution Node      | Transaction processing | High stake + performance | Block rewards + fees |
| Training Node (ICN) | AI model training      | GPU hardware             | Training Points      |
| Content Node        | Data storage           | Storage capacity         | Library Points       |
| Witness Node        | Block verification     | High IntelliPoints       | Witness rewards      |
| Committer           | Block packaging        | Selected from witnesses  | Extra rewards        |

## How Nodes Interact

1. **Execution Layer**: Execution nodes process transactions with sub-second confirmation
2. **Compute Layer**: Training nodes provide GPU resources for AI tasks
3. **Storage Layer**: Content nodes store data, models, and knowledge
4. **Block Production Layer**: Witnesses and Committers finalize blocks

## Choosing Your Role

- **High capital + high performance hardware**: Consider Execution Node
- **Strong GPU resources**: Consider Training Node (ICN)
- **Large storage capacity**: Consider Content/Knowledge Node
- **High contribution (IntelliPoints)**: Eligible for Witness selection
